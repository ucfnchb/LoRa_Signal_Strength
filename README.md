# Exploring and Analysing LoRa’s Signal Strength and Effective Range in Dense Urban Environments

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the MSc dissertation titled "Exploring and Analyzing LoRa’s Signal Strength and Effective Range in Dense Urban Environments." The dissertation investigates the performance of LoRa (Long Range) technology in urban settings, with a focus on signal strength and effective range across various urban densities.

## Abstract
The research explores LoRa’s operational effectiveness in densely and sparsely built urban areas by analyzing 246 data points collected across multiple routes. The study confirms that LoRa’s signal strength diminishes with increasing distance from the gateway, with a maximum effective range of about 3 km in sparsely built areas, and approximately 1.2 km in densely built areas. Key factors influencing signal propagation, such as building density and architectural features, are discussed. An unexpected detection of a LoRa signal from a gateway 7.5 km away in a dense urban environment suggests potential for greater coverage under specific conditions.

## Contents of the Repository
Data: Collected LoRa signal strength and related geographical data.
Code: Scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization using Python, Grafana, and QGIS.
Documentation: Detailed explanations of the methodology, including device setup, data collection, and analysis processes.
Figures: Visual representations of the data, including maps, graphs, and tables illustrating the findings.

## Key Findings
Signal Strength vs. Distance: RSSI values decrease as the distance from the gateway increases, with urban density significantly impacting effective range.
Urban Density Impact: Densely built areas have a much-reduced effective range (approx. 1.2 km) compared to sparsely built areas (up to 3 km).
Unexpected Findings: Detection of a LoRa signal from a gateway 7.5 km away indicates potential for greater-than-expected range under certain conditions.
