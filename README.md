# Exploring and Analysing LoRa’s Signal Strength and Effective Range in Dense Urban Environments
This dissertation explores the performance and limitations of LoRa (Long Range) technology in densely built urban environments, with a focus on signal strength and effective range. The study evaluates LoRa’s operational effectiveness across various urban settings, comparing densely built areas with sparsely built ones. By analysing 246 datasets collected from multiple routes, the research confirms that LoRa’s signal strength diminishes with increasing distance from the gateway and is significantly affected by urban density and architectural obstructions. The findings show that the maximum effective range of LoRa in sparsely built areas is approximately twice that in densely built areas. Furthermore, the study highlights key factors, including building density and architectural features, that significantly impact signal propagation, emphasizing the difficulties in implementing LoRa networks in densely built urban areas. An intriguing discovery in this research was the detection of a LoRa signal from a gateway 7.5 km away in the city center, far beyond the expected operational range in dense urban environments. This finding suggests that, under specific circumstances, LoRa technology may achieve greater coverage than typically anticipated. The dissertation concludes by highlighting the importance of thoughtful network design and offering recommendations for future research to enhance the performance of LoRa technology in urban IoT deployments.
